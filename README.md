# Ted Talk views prediction using machine learning.

The TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) conferences are held throughout the year to help people get inspired and spread ideas since 1984. The associated TED website consists of thousands of recordings of the talks. Users are able to watch them and leave a comment or rating.

Random Forest, Gradient Booster, and the multi-layer perception (MLP) regressor were applied to make predictions. The results were then reviewed to provide the best prediction model. The models were able to predict the views with the highest R2 score of â‰ˆ75%, performed by the Gradient Booster model.
